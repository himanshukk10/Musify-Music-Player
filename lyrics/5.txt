Let's start a new life from the darkness
Until the light reveals the end
Fear, hatred, sorrow, desperation
Even you look miserable
Look down from above I feel awful
The time has come, let's all go home
Sinister faces, growing curses
This is my last war

Angels playing disguised with devil's faces
Children cling to their coins squeezing out their wisdom
Angels planning disguised with devil's faces
Children cling on to their very last coins

Destruction and regeneration
You are the real enemy

The only memory left is trauma
Imaginary friend's kind words
The evening train was shaking
I purified the imperfect flowers
The pain in my heart getting higher
My comedy show at its peak
The frogs were crying on our way home
This is my last war

Angels playing disguised with devil's faces
Children cling to their coins squeezing out their wisdom
Angels planning disguised with devil's faces
Children cling on to their very last coins

Destruction and regeneration
You are the real enemy

Tu tu tu tu tu tu
