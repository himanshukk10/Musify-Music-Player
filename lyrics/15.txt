Our mighty fallen
Begotten power
Shoulder to shoulder
Never surrender

Apples drop beside the tree
Old man please, remember me and
All of us still chase our dream
Underneath the canopy

Steady we ride
Silhouette flying over the grass
As the daylight now dies
Our stallions breathing their last
Duty chains us
Our demons haunt us
Fighting for seeds of our crown
Death by sundown!

Steady we ride
Watching scenes playing out from our past
Like the smell of her hair
Those times always fly by so fast
Needles broken
The feeling's woken
Should we just let it all fade
Is it just time?
