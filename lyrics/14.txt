She lost her brother, month ago
His picture on a wall
And it reminds me
When she brings me coffee, her smile
I wish I could be with her 'til my last day

She said she gave all her love to me
We dreamed a new life
Some place to be at peace
But things changed, suddenly
I lost my dreams in this disaster

I'm crying
Missing my lover
I don't have the power
On my side forever
Oh, where is my lover?
And I got no power
I'm standing alone, no way
Calling out your name

I said I gave all my love to you
We dreamed a new house
Some place to be at peace
But things changed, suddenly
I lost my dreams in this disaster

We don't know what is wrong tonight
Everybody's got no place to hide
No one's left and there's no one to go on
All I know is my life is gone

I'm crying
Missing my lover
I don't have the power
On my side forever
Oh, where is my lover?
And I got no power
I'm standing alone, no way
Calling out your name
