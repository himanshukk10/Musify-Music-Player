Like the scarlet night veiling the dark
You can hide your fear
Can lie, my dear
Kono mama yume wo mite
Chi darake no tsubasa hirogete

Like a fallen angel
Toki no kaze ni
Nagasarete ochite yuku
Into the starry night
Megami no you ni
Dakishimete eien wo
Fly into heaven

What's the lie?
What's the truth?
What to believe?
In my life

See the flowers breathing in the rain
Try growing to the edge of light
It's so far away to reach out to the sky
I'll seize, I'll seize the roses with my wings
We'll fly

Like a fallen angel
Toki no kaze ni
Nagasarete ochite yuku
Into the starry night
Megami no you ni
Dakishimete eien wo

We'll fly away,
We'll find a way
You can hide your fear,
Can lie, my dear

We'll see the end
We'll be the end
Dakishimete eien wo
Fly into heaven
